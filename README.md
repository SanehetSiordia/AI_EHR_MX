##  **SQL to CSV Branch**

This section generates multiple .csv files from the database *enfermedadesresporatorias.sql* (review PDFRecopilation branch).

These files are saved inside the path: *\AI_EHR_MX\Archivos_CSV* and are ordered from the target attribute *diagnostico_final*.

There are two different folders: *1_Completos y 2_Editados*, where, in the second folder the instances with the same ID are combined and the attributes with non-significant information are deleted.

These files were used for the congress article [_**DOI:10.24254/CNIB.21.56**_](https://memoriascnib.mx/index.php/memorias/article/download/875/543)
